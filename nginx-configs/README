This folder represents the files that should be placed under:
/etc/nginx

To install:
* Delete all files under /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
* Either:
  * Copy 'mctxconfig' (under sites-enabled) to /etc/nginx/sites-available/
    and create a symlink to that file under /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
  * Create a symlink directly from 'mctxconfig' to 
    /etc/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
* Replace /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params and /etc/nginx/mime.types with the
  provided files (either by copying or symlinking)

Note:
To get the login functionality working, you need to place a .htpasswd file
under /usr/share/nginx/access (create folder if it doesn't exist). To generate
the htpasswd file, install the apache2-utils package and use the 'htpasswd'
executable.
