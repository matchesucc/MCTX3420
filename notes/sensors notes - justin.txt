PRESSURE SENSORS

-	A cheap, pretty good pressure sensor in the range required is the MPX2202 manufactured by Freescale (costs about $15).
-	For the system several will be needed? One or two inside the box, maybe a couple in the piping/pneumatics system.
-	Sensor has 3 used pins: supply voltage, ground and output voltage, and one unused.
-	Pressure is measured by the sensor and given as a scaled linear output voltage.
-	Range of 0-40mV over 0-200kPa.
-	Most Freescale sensors have analog output as far as I can tell.
-	More expensive sensors are more accurate (with less error), which might be necessary for the project. 
-	Honeywell make the Truestability series which cost around $35. 
-	These have an amplified analog output, and resolution of 0.03%.
-	Output voltage range is from 0 to the supply voltage (either 3.3V or 5.0V)
-	Sensor has 3 used pins: supply voltage, ground and output voltage, and 4/8 pins total
-	Pressure sensors which donÅft have pins (i.e. plug in via cables) are generally much more expensive and heavy-duty

STRAIN GAUGES

-	Cheap strain gauges are available from Omega ($30-40 for a pack of 5)
-	Input/output varies but it is generally a pair of solder pads or input leads. 
-	Voltage is applied to the input and a small voltage is read from the output, proportional to the strain.
-	Analog output usually in the millivolt range.
-	Number of leads/solder pads can vary, but most common is just one input wire and one output wire.
-	Multiple strain gauges can be connected to a single ÅepadÅf.
-	For the coke can we shouldnÅft need more than one or two gauges (and maybe one to measure strain on the box for safety?).
-	Micron also make strain gauges.
-	Input and output are thin 1.5cm leads or small contact pads. Same type of analog, low voltage output.
-	One input lead & one output lead.
-	Strain gauges have different shapes (bar, U-shape, M-shape) which might change the number of wires etc, but it depends on what the sensors team chooses.

REGULATORS

-	Electronic pressure regulators are made by Parker.
-	Require 12-24V supply voltage, 0-5V input voltage, and 0-5V output voltage.
-	Electrical connector has 8 contact pins: 5 for input, 2 for output, and one unused.
-	Pins are absolute zero control, supply voltage, setpoint, valve current, signal common, pressure output and valve test voltage output.
-	Emerson also make regulators that can accept both analog and digital inputs from a computer, and have can give an analog or digital output (with a single cable).
-	These are more expensive though and I'm not sure what connector the cable has.
